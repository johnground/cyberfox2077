# Creating a New Feature Branch in Git

## Introduction
This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to create and manage a new feature branch in Git for your project.

## Steps to Follow

### 1. Update Your Local Repository
Before creating a new branch, ensure your local repository is up to date with the main branch:
```bash
git checkout main
git pull
```

### 2. Create the New Feature Branch
Create and switch to your new feature branch (replace `feature-module-content` with your branch name):
```bash
git checkout -b feature-module-content
```

### 3. Push the Branch to the Remote Repository
After creating your branch locally, push it to the remote repository:
```bash
git push -u origin feature-module-content
```

### 4. Start Adding Your Changes
Begin working on your module content. Make changes, commit them, and push them to your feature branch as needed.

### 5. Regularly Pull Changes from the Main Branch
Regularly update your feature branch with changes from the main branch to avoid conflicts:
```bash
git pull origin main
```

### 6. Ready for Integration
Once your feature is complete, create a pull request to merge your feature branch back into the main branch.

## Conclusion
Following these steps will help maintain a clean and efficient workflow when adding new features to your project using Git.
