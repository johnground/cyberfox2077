Module 1: Introduction to Version Control for Cybersecurity
Version Control: What Every Cybersecurity Professional Should Know
Welcome to Module 1 of our course on Version Control for Cybersecurity Professionals. In this module, we'll explore the fundamental concepts of version control and understand its crucial role in cybersecurity practices.

Why Version Control Matters
Version control is not just for developers; it's a valuable tool for cybersecurity experts too. We'll discuss how version control helps you track changes in security policies, configurations, and incident response procedures. Learn how it enhances collaboration among security teams.

Getting Started with Git
If you're new to Git, don't worry! We'll introduce you to this popular version control system. Git's simplicity and power make it a perfect fit for managing security-related code, scripts, and configurations.

Installing GitLab with Docker
Now, let's explore how to set up a GitLab instance using Docker. GitLab provides a comprehensive platform for managing your security projects, including code repositories, issue tracking, and continuous integration.

Follow these steps to get started:

Install Docker on your system.
Pull the GitLab Docker image:
docker pull gitlab/gitlab-ce:latest
Copy
Run the GitLab container with the necessary configuration:
docker run --detach \
                       --hostname gitlab.example.com \
                       --publish 443:443 --publish 80:80 --publish 22:22 \
                       --name gitlab \
                       --restart always \
                       --volume /srv/gitlab/config:/etc/gitlab \
                       --volume /srv/gitlab/logs:/var/log/gitlab \
                       --volume /srv/gitlab/data:/var/opt/gitlab \
                       gitlab/gitlab-ce:latest
                    
Copy
Access GitLab through your web browser at http://localhost/users/sign_in. It can take a while for the page to show up because GitLab runs its initial build for quite a while before it becomes ready. Be patient :)
Setting Up Your GitLab Password
Once your GitLab instance is up and running, you will need to set up the initial root password for the root user. This is an important step to secure your GitLab instance.

Follow these steps to set your password:

Open a terminal and run the command below to access the shell of the running GitLab container:
docker exec -it gitlab bash
Copy
Then, run the command below to access the GitLab Rails console:
gitlab-rails console -e production
Copy
You will be presented with a prompt similar to this:
root@gitlab:/# gitlab-rails console -e production
Loading production environment (Rails 7.0.8)
Copy
Enter the following commands in the Rails console to set your password:
user = User.where(id: 1).first
user.password = 'your_new_password'
user.password_confirmation = 'your_new_password'
user.save!
Copy
Type exit to leave the Rails console, then exit again to leave the container. Now, you can log in to GitLab using the username root and the password you just set.

With GitLab in Docker, you'll have a powerful tool to manage your cybersecurity projects efficiently.

Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues while setting up the GitLab container with Docker, follow these troubleshooting steps:

Conflicting Container Name:

If you encounter a "container name conflict" error, stop and remove the conflicting container with the following commands:

docker stop <conflicting-container-id>
            docker rm <conflicting-container-id>
Then, attempt to start the GitLab container again.

Copy
Port 22 in Use:

If you get a "Port 22 in use" error, ensure that port 22 is not used by another service. You may need to stop the conflicting service or configure Docker to use a different SSH port.

Copy
Container Not Running:

If the GitLab container is not running, use the following command to start it:

docker start gitlab
Copy
Accessing GitLab: To access GitLab in your web browser, navigate to http://localhost/users/sign_in. GitLab may take some time to initialize during the first run.
GitLab's relevence to Cybersecurity

Private Repositories: GitLab allows you to create private repositories, which can only be accessed by authorized users. This helps to protect sensitive code and data.
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): GitLab supports RBAC, which allows you to control who has access to what within your projects. This can help to limit the potential damage if an account is compromised.
Security Scanning: GitLab includes built-in security scanning tools that can automatically scan your code for vulnerabilities. This includes Static Application Security Testing (SAST), Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST), Dependency Scanning, and Container Scanning.
Audit Logs: GitLab provides detailed audit logs, which can help you to detect and investigate suspicious activity.
Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): GitLab supports 2FA, adding an extra layer of security to user accounts.
Secrets Management: GitLab provides a way to securely store and manage sensitive information, like API keys, passwords, and certificates.
Remember, while these features can significantly enhance the security of your projects, they are not a substitute for good security practices, such as regularly updating dependencies and following the principle of least privilege.
